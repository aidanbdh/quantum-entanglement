# quantum-entanglement
An atom plugin for users that want to edit the same file in real time.

apm install quantum

Then select

Packages > quantum-entanglement > toggle

or simply right click and select toggle quantum-entanglement

Then enter in a server name (If it doesn't exist yet, just put in a name and one will generate for you)

If you are connecting to a pre-existing server, you will be asked to confirm you are okay with losing your local changes. THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE (except by undoing it with ctrl-z). Make sure the file you are on is blank or contains an older version of the file you are connecting to in order to prevent any code being lost.
